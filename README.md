Challenges
==========

General repository for coding challenges

The folders are divided on the web portals that provide exercises.

UVA: http://uva.onlinejudge.org/
SPOJ: http://br.spoj.com/
Euler: http://projecteuler.net/

Inside each folder, there will be a subfolder with the problem name, code and an input file. Sometimes an PDF with the description of the problem.
Files with the prefix 'PRO', refer to a problem with work in progress. The solution haven't been approved yet by the online judge.
